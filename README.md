# Types-of-Similarity-and-Dissimilarity-measures

 Metric:

A given distance(e.g. dissimilarity) is meant to be a metric if and only if it satisfies the following four conditions:

1- Non-negativity: d(p, q) ≥ 0, for any two distinct observations p and q.

2- Symmetry: d(p, q) = d(q, p) for all p and q.

3- Triangle Inequality: d(p, q) ≤ d(p, r) + d(r, q) for all p, q, r.

4- d(p, q) = 0 only if p = q.
